      text: `At work, people often offer to do things for others. It's important to know how to make offers in different business situations.
It's also important to know how to respond to offers in the right manner, using appropriate language.
You should be able to offer help in a way that is polite and friendly. You should also know how to accept or decline an offer of help.
In offering, accepting or declining help, the right tone is very important. What you say is sometimes not as important as how you say it. Tone adds a lot to the meaning of your words. While the right tone can help you make positive business relationships, using the wrong tone can offend others.
In this lesson, we will look at a few ways to offer, accept and decline help in words that are friendly and polite.`,
